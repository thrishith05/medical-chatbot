# Final Implementation Summary

## âœ… Your Requirements Met

### What You Asked For:
1. âœ… **Answer from ONE reliable source** - Only the best matching document is used
2. âœ… **No sources displayed in chatbox** - Contexts array is empty

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Changes (`services/rag_service.py`)
1. **Single Source Retrieval**: `k=1` - retrieves only the best matching document
2. **Empty Contexts**: Returns `contexts: []` - no sources shown
3. **Best Document**: Uses `docs[0]` - the highest relevance score

```python
# Only retrieves ONE document
docs = self.vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=1)

# Returns empty contexts
return {
    "answer": answer,
    "contexts": []  # No sources displayed
}
```

#### Frontend Changes (`frontend/app.js`)
- Context display code removed - no sources shown in UI
- Only the answer is displayed to the user

## How It Works

### Query Flow:
```
1. User asks: "What is a heart attack?"
2. System queries ChromaDB with k=1
3. Gets BEST matching document (highest relevance)
4. Extracts 2-3 most relevant sentences from that ONE document
5. Returns answer ONLY (no sources displayed)
```

### Example Response

**Query:** "What is a heart attack?"

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Severe prolonged chest pain. Severe prolonged cardiac chest pain may be due to acute myocardial infarction or to unstable angina â€“ known collectively as acute coronary syndrome.",
  "contexts": []
}
```

The chatbox shows ONLY the answer - no sources!

## Current Status

âœ… **API**: Running on port 8001  
âœ… **Frontend**: Running on port 8080  
âœ… **Single Source**: k=1 retrieval  
âœ… **No Sources**: Contexts hidden  
âœ… **ChromaDB**: 10,922 documents indexed
