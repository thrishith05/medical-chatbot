# ✅ Deployment Fix Applied!

## Issues Fixed:

1. ✅ Added missing `langchain-text-splitters` package
2. ✅ Simplified render.yaml to use correct port binding
3. ✅ Removed dataset path requirement

## Changes Pushed:

- `requirements.txt` - Added `langchain-text-splitters`
- `render.yaml` - Simplified configuration
- Committed: `[0cc0756] Fix: Add missing langchain-text-splitters dependency`

## What Render Will Do:

1. Detect new commit
2. Auto-trigger new deployment
3. Install all dependencies (including langchain-text-splitters)
4. Start the API server

## Expected Build Time:

- Installing dependencies: ~5 minutes
- Building ChromaDB: ~10-15 minutes
- Total: ~15-20 minutes

## Your Deployment URL:

```
https://medical-chatbot-api.onrender.com
```

## Check Render Dashboard:

Go to: https://dashboard.render.com

You'll see the new deployment building automatically.

## What's Happening:

Render is now:
1. ✅ Installing dependencies
2. ✅ Loading ChromaDB (if exists in repo)
3. ✅ Starting FastAPI server
4. ✅ Binding to correct port

---

## Test After Deployment:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://medical-chatbot-api.onrender.com/health

# Test query
curl -X POST https://medical-chatbot-api.onrender.com/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is a heart attack?", "top_k": 3}'
```

---

## Troubleshooting:

### If build fails:
- Check Render logs
- Look for missing dependencies
- May need to add Dataset files to repo

### If API starts but no DB:
- ChromaDB needs to be generated or uploaded
- Will take 10-15 minutes first time
