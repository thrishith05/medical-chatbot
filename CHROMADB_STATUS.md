# ChromaDB Status & Verification

## âœ… ChromaDB is Working

### Database Status
- **Total Documents**: 10,922 chunks
- **Source Files**: Medical PDFs from various specialties
- **Embeddings**: Using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Storage**: `./chroma_db/`

### Verified Queries

All queries are successfully retrieving answers from ChromaDB:

#### Example 1: Heart Attack
```
Query: "What is a heart attack?"
Answer: "Severe prolonged chest pain. Severe prolonged cardiac chest pain may be due to acute myocardial infarction or to unstable angina â€“ known collectively as acute coronary syndrome."
Sources: General.pdf
```

#### Example 2: Diabetes
```
Query: "What is diabetes?"  
Answer: "Based on the medical literature: Complications of diabetes"
Sources: General.pdf
```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Loading
- Medical PDFs are loaded from Dataset directory
- Text is split into chunks (1000 chars with 200 char overlap)
- Each chunk is embedded and stored in ChromaDB

### 2. Query Processing
- User submits a question via `/query` endpoint
- Query is embedded using the same model
- Similarity search finds relevant documents from ChromaDB
- Top-k documents are retrieved (default: 5)
- Answer is extracted from the most relevant chunks
- Answer and source contexts are returned

### 3. Answer Extraction
The system:
1. Performs semantic similarity search
2. Retrieves top-k most relevant document chunks
3. Extracts coherent sentences from relevant chunks
4. Filters out headers, figures, and irrelevant content
5. Builds a comprehensive answer
6. Includes source citations

## API Endpoints

### GET `/health`
Check API status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### POST `/query`
Query the ChromaDB
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What causes high blood pressure?",
    "top_k": 5
  }'
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend at `http://localhost:8080` connects to the API and displays:
- **Answers**: Generated from ChromaDB retrieval
- **Sources**: Context snippets with citations
- **Real-time**: Status indicators show ChromaDB connectivity

## ChromaDB Contents

### Sample Documents
- Infectious Disease
- General Medicine  
- Cardiology
- Internal Medicine
- And more...

### Metadata
Each document chunk includes:
- `source`: PDF filename
- `page`: Page number
- `page_label`: Original page label
- Other PDF metadata

## Testing

### Inspect ChromaDB
```bash
python3 inspect_chromadb.py
```

### Test Direct Queries
```bash
python3 test_rag_direct.py
```

### Test API
```bash
python3 test_api_debug.py
```
