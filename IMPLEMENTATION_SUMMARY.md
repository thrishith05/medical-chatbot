# Implementation Summary

### What Changed

The RAG service has been optimized to:
1. **Retrieve the best matching document** (lowest similarity score = best match)
2. **Extract the most relevant sentences** within that document
3. **Score sentences by query relevance** and select top 2-3 sentences
4. **Filter out headers, figures, and junk content**
5. **Return a concise answer** (200-500 characters)

### How It Works

```python
# Simplified flow:
1. Query â†’ Embed â†’ Search ChromaDB

3. Pick the BEST matching document (docs[0])
4. Extract and score sentences within that document

6. Combine into a single coherent answer
```
