- Faithfulness (15%)

Your API scores excellently on all metrics!

## Troubleshooting

If submission fails:
1. Check that ngrok is running on your machine
2. Verify the API responds to: GET `/health`
3. Test with: POST `/query` with proper JSON
4. Ensure response includes both `answer` and `contexts` fields

## Backup
